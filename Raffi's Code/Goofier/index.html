            <h2>About the Knights Templar</h2>
            <p>The Knights Templar, originally known as the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon, were a medieval Christian military order formed in the early 12th century.</p>
            <p>They were among the most skilled fighting units of the Crusades, recognized by their distinctive white mantles adorned with a red cross.</p>
            <p>The Knights Templar played a significant role in Christian finance and banking, and they were known for their vast network of financial infrastructure across Europe.</p>
            <p>Despite their prominence, the Knights Templar faced controversy and persecution, leading to their dissolution in the early 14th century.</p>
