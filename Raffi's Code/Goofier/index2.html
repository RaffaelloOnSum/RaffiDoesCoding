            <h2>About Jacques de Molay</h2>
            <p>Jacques de Molay, born in 1243 in Molay, France, was the last Grand Master of the Knights Templar, serving from 1292 until the order's dissolution.</p>
            <p>Under his leadership, the Knights Templar faced increasing pressure and scrutiny from the King of France, Philip IV, leading to their eventual arrest and persecution.</p>
            <p>Jacques de Molay was famously executed on March 19, 1314, in Paris, where he was burned at the stake.</p>
            <p>His legacy as the final Grand Master of the Knights Templar has endured through the centuries, with his defiance and martyrdom inspiring many.</p>
