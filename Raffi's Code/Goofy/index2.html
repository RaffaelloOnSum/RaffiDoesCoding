            <h2>About Iron Golem</h2>
            <p>The Iron Golem is a powerful, protective mob in the world of Minecraft. With its immense strength and imposing presence, it serves as a guardian of villages, defending them from hostile mobs and keeping the villagers safe.</p>
            <p>However, despite their role as protectors, Iron Golems can sometimes exhibit aggressive behavior towards players, especially if provoked.</p>
            <p>They have been known to attack innocent players who accidentally hit a villager or approach them too closely, often resulting in unintended conflict and harm.</p>
